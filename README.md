# UniversalMidiController
A combination of a central PCB with arduino mega, LCD display, SD card and 4 midi connectors (2 x input / 2 x output), encoder buttons + leds and ribbon cable daisy chainable sattelite boards with a raster of 4 x 4 (16) positions for pots or 12x12mm tact switches with optional LED. 
Up to 4 sattelite boards can be chained together for a total of 64 midi CC functions.
I initially created this for an Oberhein OBXa clone I am working on but the system is very universal an can be used for making any kind of synth programmer.
The example code (Matrix Programmer) is a functional example what needs some work.
It can program a Matric 1000 allready (all parameters) I still need to implement the midi inputs for merging Keyboard data with the patch programming data.
The DXF file contains the front panel drawing.
